	abstract = {Citizens all agree on the importance of objective scientific information, yet they tend to avoid scientific literature due to access restrictions, its complex language or their lack of prior background knowledge. Instead, they rely on shallow information on the web or social media often published for commercial or political incentives rather than the correctness and informational value. This paper presents an overview of the CLEF 2022 SimpleText track addressing the challenges of text simplification approaches in the context of promoting scientific information access, by providing appropriate data and benchmarks, and creating a community of IR and NLP researchers working together to resolve one of the greatest challenges of today. The track provides a corpus of scientific literature abstracts and popular science requests. It features three tasks. First, content selection (what is in, or out?) challenges systems to select passages to include in a simplified summary in response to a query. Second, complexity spotting (what is unclear?) given a passage and a query, aims to rank terms/concepts that are required to be explained for understanding this passage (definitions, context, applications). Third, text simplification (rewrite this!) given a query, asks to simplify passages from scientific abstracts while preserving the main content.},

We use a recently developed rigorous framework for complexity to understand measures of complexity. We illustrate, by example, how features of complexity can be quantified, and we analyse a selection of purported measures of complexity that have found wide application and explain whether and how they measure complexity. We also discuss some of the classic information-theoretic measures from the 1980s and 1990s. This work gives the reader a tool kit for quantifying features of complexity across the sciences.},

Because a successful term-recognition method has to be based on proper insights into the nature of terms, studies of automatic term recognition not only contribute to the applications of computational linguistics but also to the theoretical foundation of terminology. Many studies on automatic term recognition treat interesting aspects of terms, but most of them are not well founded and described. 
		This paper tries to give an overview of the principles and methods of automatic term recognition. For that purpose, two major trends are examined, i.e., studies in automatic recognition of significant elements for indexing mainly carried out in information-retrieval circles and current research in automatic term recognition in the field of computational linguistics.},
