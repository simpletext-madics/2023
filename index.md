### Lab organisers  

**Liana Ermakova (Chair, responsible for Tasks 2 and 3)** is associate professor of computer science at University of Western Brittany, France. She is the PI of the SimpleText project financed by the French National Research Agency (ANR) in 2022-2026. Dr. Ermakova chaired the JOKER@CLEF-2022 and SimpleText@CLEF 2021 and 2022 tracks. She participated in the INEX/CLEF Tweet Contextualization task in 2011-2014 and was co-organizer of CLEF Microblog Cultural Contextualization in 2016 and 2017. She is the main organizer of the SimpleText workshop at MADICS, INFORSID, and Mots/Machines.  

**Eric SanJuan (responsible for Task 1)** is permanent lecturer at the Institute of Technology of Avignon in the department of Statistics and Decision Support Systems (StID). He was co-organiser of the CLEF SimpleText track since 2021 as well as a co-organiser of MADICS and a research partner in the ANR project. Among others, he organized the following scientific activities: CLEF MC2 lab that aimed to evaluate microblog retrieval and contextualization, CLEF 2018 conference in Avignon. https://termwatch.es/  

**Stéphane Huet (Task 1)** is associate professor at the University of Avignon. He was co-organiser of the CLEF SimpleText track in 2022. He participated in CLEF 2016&2017 Cultural Microblog Contextualization Tasks, and in international machine translation tasks (WMT). https://cv.archives-ouvertes.fr/shuet  

**Jaap Kamps (Tasks 1 and 3)** is associate professor of Information Retrieval at the University of Amsterdam. He is a prolific organizer of IR evaluation tracks, including the CLEF SimpleText track since 2021 (also as research partner in the ANR project at Brest), the TREC Contextual Suggestion track 2012-2016, the CLEF Social Book Search track 2015-2016, and the INEX INititative for the Evaluation of XML Retrieval 2008-2014, see: https://e.humanities.uva.nl/  

**Olivier Augereau (Task 2)**, associate professor at École Nationale d'Ingénieurs de Brest (France), is a co-organiser of the SimpleText@MADICS workshop and a member of the French Research Group in Writing Communication (GRCE), which is interested in the SimpleText project. O. Augereau is an invited researcher at Osaka Metropolitan University and senior researcher at KEIO University. He works on text and reader mutual analysis.  

**Patrice Bellot (Task 2)** is a full professor at the University of Aix-Marseille, Laboratoire d'Informatique et Systèmes (LIS - CNRS/Aix-Marseille Université). He is co-organiser of the CLEF SimpleText track since 2021, and research partner in the ANR project. He participated in international challenges such as CLEF Social Book Search for query based recommendation, Semeval for sentiment analysis, TREC and CLEF for question-answering, TREC Entity, KBA, Medical for information retrieval and filtering. Between 2010 and 2014, he organized the Tweet Contextualization track in CLEF along with IRIT and LIMSI labs. https://ins2i.cnrs.fr/fr/personne/patrice-bellot  

A **PhD student** (to be hired on ANR) will work on Tasks 1 and 2 under the supervision of L.  Ermakova and P. Bellot.  

**Other colleagues participate in the Task organization:** Irina Ovchinnikova (ManPower Language Solution, Israel), Diana Nurbakova (INSA Lyon, France), Sílvia Araújo (University of Minho, Portugal), Radia Hannachi (University of South Brittany, France). We will also hire interns in translation and technical writing for data collection and evaluation.
